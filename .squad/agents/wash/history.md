# Project Context

- **Owner:** Marek Fišera
- **Project:** SharedSpaces — A self-hostable web platform where users join shared spaces via QR code/URL+PIN, share files and text in real-time, with anonymous identity and JWT-based access.
- **Stack:** .NET (ASP.NET Core Web API), React SPA (Vite), SignalR (WebSocket), SQLite + EF Core, JWT auth
- **Created:** 2026-03-16

## Core Context

### Client Architecture
- React SPA built with Vite — independently deployable
- Can connect to any SharedSpaces server by URL
- A single client instance may connect to multiple servers simultaneously
- JWT stored in local storage per server+space combination

### Key Client Flows
- Join flow: parse invitation string or QR URL → display name input → exchange PIN for JWT
- Multi-server: JWT claims contain server_url and space_id — client manages multiple connections
- Space view: flat list of items ordered by SharedAt, text/file upload
- SignalR: connect to /v1/hubs/space/{spaceId} for live item updates (new/deleted)

### Project Structure (Client)
- src/SharedSpaces.Client/src/
  - features/ — join, space-view, admin
  - components/ — shared UI components
  - hooks/ — useSignalR, useOfflineQueue
  - main.tsx

**Mal completed issue decomposition:** 14 GitHub issues (#17–#30) created spanning 5 phases:
- **Phase 1 (Core Server):** #17–#21 (5 issues) — API, auth, schema
- **Phase 2 (Real-time):** #22 (1 issue) — SignalR
- **Phase 3 (React Client):** #23–#26 (4 issues) — Join flow, space view, upload (your work starts here)
- **Phase 4 (Admin UI):** #27 (1 issue) — Dashboard
- **Phase 5 (Offline & Polish):** #28–#30 (3 issues) — Offline queue, Docker

All issues labeled with `squad`, `phase:N`, and category (backend/frontend/infrastructure/real-time). Dependencies explicit in issue descriptions. You can start Phase 3 once Phase 1 APIs are available.
