### Issue Decomposition: SharedSpaces Implementation Plan

**Decision Date:** 2026-03-16  
**Decided By:** Mal (Lead/Architect)  
**Status:** Active

#### Context
The SharedSpaces README defines a 5-phase implementation plan (Core Server → Real-time → React Client → Admin UI → Offline & Polish). We needed to decompose this into GitHub issues that developers can pick up and execute independently.

#### Decision
Created 14 GitHub issues (#17-#30) with the following structure:

**Granularity**
- Each issue is a coherent unit of work for one developer
- Not too fine-grained (avoided 1 issue per endpoint)
- Not too coarse (avoided 1 issue per phase)
- Target: 10-15 issues total

**Issue Content**
- Clear, specific titles
- Detailed acceptance criteria (checkbox lists)
- Technical notes with architectural context
- Explicit dependencies (references to other issues)
- Labels: 'squad' + phase label (phase:1-5) + category label (backend/frontend/infrastructure/real-time)

**Phase Distribution**
- **Phase 1 (Core Server):** 5 issues — highest complexity, foundational work
- **Phase 2 (Real-time):** 1 issue — focused SignalR implementation
- **Phase 3 (React Client):** 4 issues — parallel to server work, can start independently
- **Phase 4 (Admin UI):** 1 issue — straightforward UI work
- **Phase 5 (Offline & Polish):** 3 issues — independent enhancements

**Key Architectural Decisions Embedded in Issues**
- Client-generated item GUIDs (not server-generated)
- JWT claims include server_url for multi-server client support
- Admin auth via simple header secret (X-Admin-Secret), not JWT
- File storage abstraction layer for future cloud swap
- Invitation PINs deleted immediately after JWT issuance
- JWT has no expiration; validity = SpaceMember.IsRevoked check

#### Rationale
- **Why 14 issues instead of 30+?** Each issue groups logically related work (e.g., #20 covers entire join/auth flow rather than splitting into 4 separate issues). This reduces coordination overhead and makes each issue independently valuable.
- **Why explicit dependencies?** Developers need to know what must be done first; no ambiguity about ordering.
- **Why detailed acceptance criteria?** Reduces back-and-forth; developers understand "done" without constantly referring to README.

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Clear work breakdown, each issue independently implementable, dependencies explicit, labels enable filtering
- **Negative:** Requirement changes require multiple issue updates; some issues (e.g., #21) are large (2-3 days)
- **Mitigations:** Issues can be split during execution; regular standups catch changes early

#### Alternatives Considered
1. **One issue per endpoint (30+ issues)** — Rejected: too granular, increases coordination, obscures "big picture"
2. **One issue per phase (5 issues)** — Rejected: too coarse, impossible parallelization, creates bottlenecks
3. **Milestone-based grouping without explicit dependencies** — Rejected: developers wouldn't know what to work on first

### SQLite Path Resolution and Startup Migrations

**Decision Date:** 2026-03-16  
**Decided By:** Kaylee (Backend Dev)  
**Status:** Active

#### Context
Issue #17 introduced the first ASP.NET Core server scaffold plus EF Core with SQLite. We needed local runtime startup and `dotnet ef` tooling to behave consistently against the same database file.

#### Decision
Keep the SQLite connection string in configuration as `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`, and normalize its relative `Data Source` through `SqliteConnectionStringResolver` for both runtime registration and the design-time `AppDbContextFactory`. Also apply pending EF Core migrations during startup through `DatabaseInitializationExtensions.InitializeDatabaseAsync()`.

#### Rationale
This keeps local setup zero-config while avoiding the common mismatch where `dotnet run` and `dotnet ef` create different SQLite files depending on the working directory. It also means future backend slices can assume the schema is applied when the API starts.

#### Impact
- SQLite database file is normalized to a consistent location regardless of working directory
- Pending migrations auto-apply on API startup
- Fresh local environments require zero manual database setup

### Test Project Scaffold Alignment

**Decision Date:** 2026-03-16  
**Decided By:** Zoe (Tester)  
**Status:** Active

#### Context
Issue #17 was laying down the .NET solution/server scaffold, and the server test project needed to be created in parallel to avoid blocking test infrastructure decisions.

#### Decision
Keep the server test project on the same target framework and EF Core package line as `src/SharedSpaces.Server`, and pin `FluentAssertions` to 6.12.0 for now.

#### Rationale
Matching the server scaffold avoids package drift before real tests land, and the older FluentAssertions release avoids the new commercial-license warning in routine test runs.

#### Impact
- Test project uses xUnit, Moq 4.20.70, FluentAssertions 6.12.0, EF Core InMemory
- Future server test work should preserve framework/package alignment unless the team intentionally upgrades the server stack first
- Test database isolation via InMemory provider avoids external dependencies

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
